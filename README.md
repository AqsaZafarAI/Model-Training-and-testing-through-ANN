Model Training with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on the MNIST Dataset
This project demonstrates basic machine learning techniques, focusing on training a model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which can be loaded directly within the code using mnist.load_data(). 
After training, the model achieves a test accuracy of 87%.
